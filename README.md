 Visualizing Genetic Algorithms

The goal of the project is to provide students of the Institute of Computer Science and everyone interested in the topic of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) with a web tool for studying them. The tool includes theoretical information about GAs, an interactive visualization of GA, and a python code of the knapsack problem with GA.
